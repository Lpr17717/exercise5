    <div>It's unfortunate to hear
        about the bankruptcy
        of Final-ly, a company that
        was attempting to disrupt
        the funeral industry by
        providing more affordable
        and modern services. The
        high costs and emotional
        burden associated with
        funerals make it a difficult
        industry to innovate in,
        especially when there are
        established players with
        deep roots in the market.</div>

    <div>While Final-ly's bankruptcy is a
        disappointment for its investors
        and employees, it's important to
        acknowledge the positive impact
        the company had on the industry.
        By starting conversations about
        the need for change and bringing
        new innovations to the market,
        Final-ly may have paved the way
        for future companies to succeed
        in disrupting the funeral industry.</div>
